\chapter{Discussion}

\begin{itemize}
    \item external validity of this tool
    \item  General usability - does it work across all plant and animal genomes 
    \item Extensions in features
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Limitations - Should mirror future improvements
    \item Pan genome synteny
    \item Linking into genomeDB, NCBI to provide tighter intetgrations.
    \item No dependence on MCSCanX or DAGChainer or any syteny detection system
\end{itemize}
 

Conclusion â€“ This is a reminder what we did , what our contributions. Minaly providing a  tool that solves these 3 aforementioned problems. Set of smaller contributions such as requirements analysis. Created some special datasets. 
Finally a concluding paragraph
