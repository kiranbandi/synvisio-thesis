% NAME OF ACADEMIC UNIT
%
% The following two commands allow you to specify the academic unit you belong to.
% This will appear on the title page as
% ``<academic unit> of <department>''.
% So if you are in the division of biomedical engineering you would need to do:
% \department{Biomedical Engineering}
% \academicunit{Division}
%
% The default is ``Department of Computer Science'' if these commands
% are not given.
%
% If you are in a discipline other than Computer Science, uncomment the following line and
% specify your discipline/department.  Default is 'Computer Science'.
% \department{If not Computer Science, put the name of your department here}

% If you are not in a department, but say, a division, uncomment the following line.
% \academicunit{Put the type of academic unit you belong to here, e.g. Division, College}


% PERMISSION TO USE ADDRESS
%
% If you are not in Comptuer Science you will want to change the
% address on the Permission to Use page.  This is done using the
% \ptuaddress{}.  Example:
%
% \ptuaddress{Head of the Department of Computer Science\\
% 176 Thorvaldson Building\\
% 110 Science Place\\
% University of Saskatchewan\\
% Saskatoon, Saskatchewan\\
% Canada\\
% S7N 5C9

% ABSTRACT
\abstract{
Due to rapid advancements in sequencing technologies high resolution genomic data is readily available for a wide range of species. However, analysing this huge volume of data is still a tedious task. While most genomic analysis tasks can be automated some still require human judgement and manual interpretation. One example of such a task is synteny analysis. Synteny is a key tool in comparative genomic research - it is the study of homologous regions within chromosomes of the same or different species. Visualizing synteny can help researchers in understanding the \textbf{location, size and orientation} of shared sequences among genomes of interest. However, the current tools which exist for synteny analysis are stand-alone programs or command line tools that are difficult to use and that offer very little interactivity. In this paper we provide a decentralized web-based environment for browsing syntenic blocks with multiple visual representations in the form of linear charts, hive charts and dot plots. Our tool also makes it easy to save and revisit graphs so that researchers can iteratively refine their plots and compare them with previous revisions for changes. We present SynVisio, a multiscale synteny analysis tool that provides multiple visualizations of genome collinearity for easy exploration across different scales from the whole genome level all the way down to the individual gene block level.
